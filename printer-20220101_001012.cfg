# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2020 Creality Ender 3
# Pro with the 32-bit Creality 4.2.2 board. To use this config, during
# "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader" and
# serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) communication.

# If you prefer a direct serial connection, in "make menuconfig"
# select "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and select
# serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10), which is broken out on the 10 pin IDC
# cable used for the LCD module as follows:
# 3: Tx, 4: Rx, 9: GND, 10: VCC

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

# The number of points to probe on each axis, specified as x,y integer values. In this example 5 points will be probed along the X axis,
# with 3 points along the Y axis, for a total of 15 probed points. Note that if you wanted a square grid, for example 3x3, 
#this could be specified as a single integer value that is used for both axes, ie probe_count: 3. Note that a mesh requires 
#a minimum probe_count of 3 along each axis.

horizontal_move_z: 5 # The Z coordinate the probe rises to prior to traveling between points.
mesh_min: 16,6 #10,10 The first probed coordinate, nearest to the origin. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location.
mesh_max: 220,234 #The probed coordinate farthest farthest from the origin. This is not necessarily the last point probed, as the probing process occurs in a zig-zag fashion. As with mesh_min, this coordiante is relative to the probe's location.
